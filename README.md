# Program-to-Generate-a-Random-Number
This repository contains Python code snippets for generating random numbers using the random module.
The code demonstrates how to use the random.randint() function to generate random integers within specified ranges and how to print these random numbers. 
The second part specifically shows an example of simulating a dice roll by generating a random number between 1 and 6.
